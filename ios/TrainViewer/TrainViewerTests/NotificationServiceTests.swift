// MARK: - Mock Notification Center (for future use)

/*
 Note: For more comprehensive testing, you would want to create a mock UNUserNotificationCenter
 and inject it into the NotificationService. This would allow testing:
 
 1. Verification that notifications are actually scheduled
 2. Checking notification content and timing
 3. Testing notification removal and updates
 4. Verifying proper error handling
 
 Example mock structure:
 
 protocol NotificationCenterProtocol {
     func requestAuthorization(options: UNAuthorizationOptions) async throws -> Bool
     func add(_ request: UNNotificationRequest) async throws
     func getPendingNotificationRequests() async -> [UNNotificationRequest]
     func removePendingNotificationRequests(withIdentifiers: [String])
 }
 
 class MockNotificationCenter: NotificationCenterProtocol {
     var scheduledNotifications: [UNNotificationRequest] = []
     var authorizationGranted = true
     
     func requestAuthorization(options: UNAuthorizationOptions) async throws -> Bool {
         return authorizationGranted
     }
     
     func add(_ request: UNNotificationRequest) async throws {
         scheduledNotifications.append(request)
     }
     
     // ... other methods
 }
