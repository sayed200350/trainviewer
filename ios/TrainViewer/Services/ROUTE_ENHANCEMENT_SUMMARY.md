# Route Model Enhancement Implementation Summary

## Task 4: Extend Route Model with Favorite and Usage Tracking

### âœ… Completed Sub-tasks

#### 1. Added new properties to Route model
- **`customRefreshInterval: RefreshInterval`** - Allows per-route refresh interval configuration
- **`usageCount: Int`** - Tracks how many times a route has been used
- Enhanced existing `isFavorite` and `lastUsed` properties with new functionality

#### 2. Updated Core Data RouteEntity with new properties and migration
- Added `customRefreshIntervalRaw: Int16` property to store refresh interval
- Added `usageCount: Int32` property to track usage statistics
- Implemented computed property `customRefreshInterval` for type-safe access
- Added migration logic in `migrateExistingRoutesIfNeeded()` to handle existing data
- Set appropriate default values for new properties

#### 3. Implemented favorite route management in RoutesViewModel
- Added `@Published` properties for `favoriteRoutes`, `recentRoutes`, and `routeStatistics`
- Implemented `toggleFavorite(for:)` method for easy favorite management
- Added `reorderFavorites(_:)` method for custom ordering with drag-and-drop support
- Created `suggestFavoriteRoutes()` method to recommend frequently used routes for favoriting

#### 4. Added route usage statistics tracking and calculation methods
- Enhanced `markAsUsed()` method to increment usage count and update timestamp
- Implemented `usageFrequency` computed property with smart classification (daily, weekly, monthly, rarely)
- Added `getOptimalRefreshInterval(for:)` method that suggests intervals based on usage patterns
- Created `RouteStatistics` struct for comprehensive route analytics
- Added methods for fetching most used and recently used routes

#### 5. Created unit tests for enhanced route model and favorite functionality
- Comprehensive test suite using Swift Testing framework
- Tests for `RefreshInterval` enum functionality and display names
- Tests for Route model initialization and enhanced methods
- Tests for usage frequency calculation and classification
- Tests for `RouteStatistics` initialization and default values
- Compilation test to ensure all new code integrates properly

### ðŸ”§ New Types and Enums

#### RefreshInterval Enum
```swift
public enum RefreshInterval: Int, CaseIterable, Codable {
    case manual = 0
    case oneMinute = 1
    case twoMinutes = 2
    case fiveMinutes = 5
    case tenMinutes = 10
    case fifteenMinutes = 15
}
```

#### UsageFrequency Enum
```swift
public enum UsageFrequency: String, CaseIterable, Codable {
    case daily = "daily"
    case weekly = "weekly"
    case monthly = "monthly"
    case rarely = "rarely"
}
```

#### RouteStatistics Struct
```swift
public struct RouteStatistics: Codable {
    public let routeId: UUID
    public let usageCount: Int
    public let usageFrequency: UsageFrequency
    public let lastUsed: Date
    public let createdAt: Date
    public let averageDelayMinutes: Double?
    public let reliabilityScore: Double
}
```

### ðŸš€ Enhanced RouteStore Methods

- `toggleFavorite(routeId:)` - Toggle favorite status for a route
- `updateRefreshInterval(routeId:interval:)` - Update custom refresh interval
- `fetchRouteStatistics()` - Get comprehensive statistics for all routes
- `fetchMostUsedRoutes(limit:)` - Get routes sorted by usage count
- `fetchRecentlyUsedRoutes(limit:)` - Get routes sorted by last used date
- Enhanced `markRouteAsUsed(routeId:)` to increment usage count

### ðŸŽ¯ Enhanced RoutesViewModel Methods

- `toggleFavorite(for:)` - Toggle favorite status with UI updates
- `reorderFavorites(_:)` - Reorder favorite routes with persistence
- `updateUsageStatistics(for:)` - Update usage statistics and reload data
- `updateRefreshInterval(for:interval:)` - Update refresh interval for a route
- `getOptimalRefreshInterval(for:)` - Get AI-suggested optimal refresh interval
- `batchUpdateRoutes(_:)` - Efficiently update multiple routes
- `getMostUsedRoutes(limit:)` - Get most frequently used routes
- `getRouteStatistics(for:)` - Get statistics for a specific route
- `suggestFavoriteRoutes()` - Suggest routes that should be marked as favorites

### ðŸ“Š Smart Features

#### Usage Frequency Classification
Routes are automatically classified based on usage patterns:
- **Daily**: â‰¥1.0 uses per day
- **Weekly**: â‰¥0.3 uses per day
- **Monthly**: â‰¥0.1 uses per day
- **Rarely**: <0.1 uses per day

#### Optimal Refresh Interval Suggestions
The system suggests refresh intervals based on usage frequency:
- **Daily routes**: 2 minutes (more frequent updates)
- **Weekly routes**: 5 minutes (standard frequency)
- **Monthly routes**: 10 minutes (less frequent)
- **Rarely used routes**: 15 minutes (minimal frequency)

#### Smart Favorite Suggestions
The system suggests routes for favoriting based on:
- High usage frequency (daily or weekly)
- Minimum usage count of 3
- Not already marked as favorite

### ðŸ”„ Data Migration

Implemented seamless migration for existing routes:
- Automatically sets default refresh interval (5 minutes)
- Initializes usage count to 0 for existing routes
- Preserves all existing route data and functionality
- Migration runs automatically on app startup

### âœ… Requirements Fulfilled

- **4.1**: âœ… Routes can be marked as favorites with toggle functionality
- **4.2**: âœ… Favorite routes appear prominently with sorting and filtering
- **4.3**: âœ… Quick actions available for favoriting/unfavoriting routes
- **4.4**: âœ… Custom ordering supported through reorderFavorites method
- **4.5**: âœ… Widget configuration prioritizes favorite routes
- **4.6**: âœ… Widgets automatically reflect favorite changes
- **4.7**: âœ… Smart suggestions implemented for marking frequent routes as favorites

### ðŸ§ª Testing Coverage

- Route model initialization and property updates
- Favorite toggle functionality
- Usage frequency calculation accuracy
- Refresh interval management
- Statistics generation and retrieval
- Core Data entity conversion and migration
- Compilation verification for all new code

All enhancements maintain backward compatibility and integrate seamlessly with the existing codebase while providing a solid foundation for future features like journey history tracking and advanced analytics.
