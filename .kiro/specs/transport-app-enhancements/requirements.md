# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the next phase of TrainViewer enhancements. Building on the existing fully functional iOS app, this phase focuses on addressing current limitations, improving user experience, and adding advanced features that will enhance user adoption and satisfaction.

The app currently has comprehensive public transport journey planning, real-time departures, widgets, and offline support. This enhancement phase targets widget visibility issues, performance optimizations, advanced user features, and UI/UX improvements.

3. WHEN accessing favorites THEN the system SHALL provide quick actions (view departures, edit, remove favorite)
4. WHEN multiple favorites exist THEN the system SHALL allow custom ordering by drag and drop
5. WHEN widgets are configured THEN favorite routes SHALL be prioritized in selection options
6. WHEN favorites are updated THEN widgets SHALL automatically reflect changes
7. IF no favorites exist THEN the system SHALL suggest marking frequently used routes as favorites

### Requirement 5: Journey History and Statistics

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my travel history and statistics about my journeys, so that I can understand my travel patterns and make better planning decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN journeys are taken THEN the system SHALL automatically log departure times and routes used
2. WHEN viewing history THEN the system SHALL show past journeys with dates, times, and routes
3. WHEN analyzing patterns THEN the system SHALL display weekly/monthly travel statistics
4. WHEN showing statistics THEN the system SHALL include most used routes, peak travel times, and frequency
5. WHEN privacy is enabled THEN users SHALL be able to disable history tracking
6. WHEN storage limits are reached THEN the system SHALL automatically clean old history data
7. IF patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL suggest route optimizations or schedule adjustments

### Requirement 6: Customizable Refresh Intervals

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control how often the app refreshes departure information for different routes, so that I can balance data freshness with battery usage based on my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring routes THEN the system SHALL allow setting custom refresh intervals per route
2. WHEN intervals are set THEN options SHALL include 1, 2, 5, 10, 15 minutes and manual only
3. WHEN near departure time THEN the system SHALL automatically increase refresh frequency regardless of settings
4. WHEN battery is low THEN the system SHALL suggest reducing refresh intervals to save power
5. WHEN on cellular data THEN the system SHALL provide option to reduce refresh frequency
6. WHEN widgets are configured THEN they SHALL respect individual route refresh settings
7. IF background refresh is disabled THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate manual refresh is required

### Requirement 7: Dark Mode Optimization and UI Polish
